#Shutdown

This is a simple linux shell script that will run 

sudo sh -c "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && shutdown -h 1"

when executed.  Make sure to give the script execution priviledges.

On the Shutdown.ico file, replace the username and path with your information.

The icon is from

You should totally got check out their site.  They have a ton of cool icons for everything.  In fact, the artist [dakirby309](http://dakirby309.deviantart.com/) didn't even make that icon for Linux, he made it for Windows Metro.  But I thought it was a cool icon and fit well into the Linux Mint color scheme, so I used it.
